Instructions for forsen Bajs
# #In progress#

# GitHub:
- This is the GitHub repository and will be the wiki of all instructions. In this README.md will summarize all the current ways to find, meet, contact, signal, communicate with bajs. Search for the user 'forsenTV' and his repository 'forsen'. Under 'Discussions', you are welcome to suggest new ways.

## Telegram: 
- There wasn't a convenient group on telegram and certain keywords were taken. I have created [t.me/forsenlol](t.me/forsenlol).

## On YouTube:
- You could also discuss future plans in [Simone Björklund](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1VPGc234CoeBjKiO8-ymMw/videos)'s youtube channel. Preferably the newest video, and sort by new. She's a nice person and understand us.

## On Steam:
- Join the Snus Brotherhood group's live chat to discuss plans.
    - Beware, weebs may be present at large numbers.

## On Discord:
- **Don't.** No matter what, don't use forsen discord.

## Amateur Radio Frequencies:
- **This is due to change.**
- You may suggest frequencies for ITU Region 1.
- I have arbitrarily chosen the following frequency for licensed Amateur Satellite:
    - 12m Licensed:
        - 24955.00 kHz
- If you are not licensed and can't broadcast, you may still listen. You could use WebSDR.
    - For example: http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901

## Chess sites: 
- **Lichess:** Head for the user FORSEN, select latest game, there is a spectator room chat. I advise to fully analyze the game, there is a serious blunder. https://lichess.org/iiM2UTe4
- **Chess.com:** Same process as Lichess. https://www.chess.com/game/live/5410325721?username=forsen

## Google Maps:
-  Search for [Forsen, Sweden](https://www.google.com/maps/place/730+91+Forsen,+Sweden/@59.7665902,15.5497648,17.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x465dc99d5b1e2891:0x83561019fe7f41a9!8m2!3d59.766667!4d15.5499999). There are two options, one digital and one physical.
    - **Digital:** There is a leather club nearby. Post a review to communicate. Keep in mind there are no replies/comments for reviews.
    - **Physical coordinates:** **Long=59.766°N Lat=15.550°E**. In case of an emergency, apocalypse, alien invasion, etc. We would all meet there and plan accordingly the next steps.
      - For rich bajs: You may buy land nearby in these coordinates, build a club, place with beds to sleep. Basically a place to live for homeless bajs. If you bought land nearby the coordinates, inform us. We may hold yearly conventions there, after the land is bought and built on.
