Instructions for forsen Bajs

# GitHub:
- This is the GitHub repository and will be the wiki of all instructions. In this README.md will summarize all the current ways to find, meet, contact, signal, communicate with bajs. Search for the user 'forsenTV' and his repository 'forsen'. Under 'Discussions', you are welcome to suggest new ways.

## Telegram: 
- There wasn't a convenient group on telegram and certain keywords were taken. I have created [t.me/forsenlol](t.me/forsenlol).

## On YouTube:
- You could also discuss future plans in [Simone Björklund](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1VPGc234CoeBjKiO8-ymMw/videos)'s youtube channel. Preferably the newest video, and sort by new. She's a nice person and understand us.

## On Steam:
- Join the [Snus Brotherhood](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Snus_Brotherhood) group's live chat to discuss plans.
    - Beware, weebs may be present at large numbers.

## On Discord:
- **Don't.** No matter what, don't use forsen discord.

## Amateur Radio Frequencies:
- **This is due to change.**
- You may suggest frequencies for ITU Region 1.
- I have arbitrarily chosen the following frequency for licensed Amateur Satellite:
    - 12m Licensed:
        - 24955.00 kHz
- If you are not licensed and can't broadcast, you may still listen. You could use WebSDR.
    - For example: http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901

## Twitch:
- [forsenbajs channel's chat](https://www.twitch.tv/forsenbajs).
- Using forsen's offline chat is your own risk. But if you have to, be careful. If you need help on how to behave in forsen's offline chat, ping pajlada and he will offer some help. If pajlada does not answer, type /mods and copy all the names. Post in chat, following with your question.

## Chess sites: 
- **Lichess:** Head for the user FORSEN, select latest game, there is a spectator room chat. I advise to fully analyze the game, there is a serious blunder. https://lichess.org/iiM2UTe4
- **Chess.com:** Same process as Lichess. https://www.chess.com/game/live/5410325721?username=forsen

    - **Digital:** There is a leather club nearby. Post a review to communicate. Keep in mind there are no replies/comments for reviews.
    - **Physical coordinates:** **Long=59.766°N Lat=15.550°E**. In case of an emergency, apocalypse, alien invasion, etc. We would all meet there and plan accordingly the next steps.
      - For rich bajs: You may buy land nearby in these coordinates, build a club, place with beds to sleep. Basically a place to live for homeless bajs. If you bought land nearby the coordinates, inform us. We may hold yearly conventions there, after the land is bought and built on.

## Morse Code:
- For bajs who understand the Morse communique, head to https://www.halb.it/morsecode/?ch=1 This is an online morse code room, you may communicate there.

## Imgur:
- WARNING monkaE ! Go the account forsen imgur.com/user/forsen, go to his comments, enter the [imgur he commented](https://imgur.com/user/forsen/comments). Sort by new, you may now discuss in that imgur's comments.

## Instagram:

- In case Peppah's instagram is deleted. Search for [#forsen tag](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/forsen/), in top posts you should be able to see a horsen picture! Communicate there. In case the horsen post does not appear anymore in the top posts, communicate in the first top post.

## Facebook for Boomers:
Boomers may communicate in this active forsen facebook group, called [Forsen International Community, its id is forsenlol](https://www.facebook.com/groups/forsenlol).

## Naruto Fanfic Forums:
- Head to the forum fanverse, originall named NarutoForums. Find [user forsen](https://www.fanverse.org/members/forsen.276659/), and enter his fanfic thread.

## TikTok:
- Zoomers may communivate. Avoid at all costs, should be the last resort in any case. Go to the account [forsen](https://www.tiktok.com/@forsen?) and discuss plans in newest video.

## Omegle:
- Add to the interests 'forsen', you can also add other related tags. You are now able to do as you wish with another baj.
    - You must be 18+ or 13+ with parental permission and supervision to use Omegle.

## Video Games:
- In all possible games where you can interact with other people. Always look for forsen keywords, in guilds, usernames, chat, etc.
- If voice chat is enabled, at all time, broadcast signals that bajs will understand.

## WeChat:
- Best option out there! I advise you to choose and use only WeChat!


## Magnet Link / Torrenting sites:
- Pirated bajs can create magnet links and post on Torrent sites, so when searching 'forsen', the torrent will appear. Only text files are allowed. While/After you torrent the text file, usually torrenting applications has an option to see chat for that magnet. You may communicate there.

## Anything Batman related:
- Anything that is somewhat related to Batman and his chest, will have bajs gathered. Go there.

## In Uganda:
- Join the Ugandan army. Request to be recruited as a sniper, both shooters and spotters are great. You are now as safe as you can be. Fight.

## Local Bajs:
- Hang a Ugandan Flag on your windows, balcony. That way bajs can locate where other bajs live.
- If you go to a bar, or simply walking down the street. You must wear a forsen shirt at all times.
- If you have spotted a forsen shirt, you need to approach carefully the baj and communicate.

## In mental asylums:
- Be on good behavior for the first 2 weeks. Then you may apply for changing a location. Make a request for the Stockholm asylum. If you see any green screens, turn around quitely and go the other direction.

## If you've been kidnapped by aliens:
- Ask to dance in outer space. Bajs may spot in the sky, I assure you they won't believe their eyes.

## In case you made it to Heaven:
- Ask a local angel where to locate the communities' notice board. Search for the forsen bajs community, and head there to meet the dead bajs.

## If you made it to Hell:
- You're now in the bog. Try to be nice with your torturer, and he may allow you to visit other bajs in the dungeon.

## 4th Dimension:
- If it's your first time in the 4th Dimension, I advise you to learn about it. Here is a great viedo explaining it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGguwYPC32I&t=186s
- Head for (x,y,z,w)=(0,0,0,0) (Don't confuse w for time, that's what many new 4th dimensional beings confuse with). You are most likely not there. It's the regular spawn area, will be very crowded, but a fellow baj should be there to guide you.
